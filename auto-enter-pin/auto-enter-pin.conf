#Providing the sim card identifier(s) is optional
#if it is present, we'll check the sim was not changed before entering the pin.
#if not, we just enter the pin (so that if the sim is no the proper one, you loose one trial...)

# sim1 corresponds to the modem listed /ril_0
# sim2 corresponds to the modem listed /ril_1
#If you do not want to use this feature comment the line or erase the value
